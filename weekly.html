      <h3>Week 1</h3>
      <p>I was tasked with reading the following papers:</p>

      <ul style="line-height:1.4;">
        <li><i>Planning Considerations for Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters</i> by Saeed Iqbal, Rinku Gupta, and Yung-Chin Fang.</li>
        <li><i>Utilization, Predictability, Workloads, and User Runtime Estimates in Scheduling the IBM SP2 with Backfilling</i>
        by Ahuva W. Mu'alem and Dror G. Feitelson</li>
        <li><i>Analysis of the Tradeoffs between Energy and Run Time for Multilevel Checkpointing</i> by
          Prasanna Balaprakash, Leonardo A. Bautista Gomez, Mohamed-Slim Bouguerra, Stefan M. Wild,
          Franck Cappello, and Paul D. Hovland
        </li>
        <li><i>Evaluating Energy and Power Impacts of Multilevel Checkpointing MPI Applications on Three Parallel Architectures: An Empirical Case Study</i> by
        Xingfu Wu, Valerie Taylor, and Zhiling Lan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first paper I read was <i>Planning Considerations for Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters</i>. <a href="ConsiderationsNotes.pdf">(My Notes)</a></p>
      <p>Some of the terminology from this paper such as <b>throughput</b> and <b>utilization</b> were familiar to me
      from taking CS351. I was not familiar with some other terms in the paper such as <b>load balancing</b> and <b>round robin scheduling</b>. So
    to better my understanding I read more information about <a href="http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/OpSystems/Myos/roundRobinSchedule.htm">round robin scheduling
    </a> and read a quick definition defining load balancing. This paper provided me with the basics of scheduling in cluster computing.</p>

    <p>Second, I read <i>Utilization, Predictability, Workloads, and User Runtime Estimates in Scheduling the IBM SP2 with Backfilling</i>. <a href="estimatenotes.pdf">(My Notes)</a></p>
    <p>This paper began by detailing two backfilling algorithms: <b>EASY</b> and <b>Conservative Backfilling</b>. It concluded by
    discussing and comparing data from two simulations with one run using EASY backfilling and the other conservative backfilling. It also looked specifically at user
  estimate runtimes and their effect on performance. Something that stood out to me in this work
was the revelation that better user runtime estimates do not necessarily produce better outcomes.</p>

<p>Next, I read <i>Analysis of the Tradeoffs between Energy and Run Time for Multilevel Checkpointing</i>.
  <a href="multilevelnotes.pdf">(My Notes)</a>
</p>
<p>The concept of <b>bi-objective optimzation</b> was brought up in this paper several times as were the terms
  <b>pareto optimal</b> and <b>pareto fronts</b>. This was my first introduction to these concepts. I understood these as described by the paper.</p>

<p>Lastly I read <i>Evaluating Energy and Power Impacts of Multilevel Checkpointing MPI Applications on Three Parallel Architectures: An Empirical Case Study</i>.<a href="empnotes.pdf">(My Notes)</a><p>
  <p>I was unfamiliar with <b>MPI</b> or <b>Message Passing Interface</b> so I did some supplemental reading to get an idea about what this was.</p>

<p>For now, I have no additional questions about these papers, but as I work more with these concepts I expect some to arise.</p>
