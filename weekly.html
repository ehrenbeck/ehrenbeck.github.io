      <h3>Week 1</h3>
      <p>I was tasked with reading the following papers:</p>

      <ul style="line-height:1.4;">
        <li><i>Planning Considerations for Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters</i> by Saeed Iqbal, Rinku Gupta, and Yung-Chin Fang.</li>
        <li><i>Utilization, Predictability, Workloads, and User Runtime Estimates in Scheduling the IBM SP2 with Backfilling</i>
        by Ahuva W. Mu'alem and Dror G. Feitelson</li>
        <li><i>Analysis of the Tradeoffs between Energy and Run Time for Multilevel Checkpointing</i> by
          Prasanna Balaprakash, Leonardo A. Bautista Gomez, Mohamed-Slim Bouguerra, Stefan M. Wild,
          Franck Cappello, and Paul D. Hovland
        </li>
        <li><i>Evaluating Energy and Power Impacts of Multilevel Checkpointing MPI Applications on Three Parallel Architectures: An Empirical Case Study</i> by
        Xingfu Wu, Valerie Taylor, and Zhiling Lan</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The first paper I read was <i>Planning Considerations for Job Scheduling in HPC Clusters</i>. <a href="ConsiderationsNotes.pdf">(My Notes)</a></p>
      <p>Some of the terminology from this paper such as <b>throughput</b> and <b>utilization</b> were familiar to me
      from taking CS351. I was not familiar with some other terms in the paper such as <b>load balancing</b> and <b>round robin scheduling</b>. So
    to better my understanding I read more information about <a href="http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/OpSystems/Myos/roundRobinSchedule.htm">round robin scheduling
    </a> and read a quick definition defining load balancing. This paper provided me with the basics of scheduling in cluster computing.</p>

    <p>Second, I read <i>Utilization, Predictability, Workloads, and User Runtime Estimates in Scheduling the IBM SP2 with Backfilling</i>. <a >(My Notes)</a></p>
    <p>This paper began by detailing two backfilling algorithms: <b>EASY</b> and <b>Conservative Backfilling</b>. It concluded by
    discussing and comparing data from two simulations with one run using EASY backfilling and the other conservative backfilling. </p>
